# 1.) Overview

For this task we helped our friend Steve's parents analyze some of their favorite energy stocks to see how they performed over a couple years.  Using this anaylsis we can decide if the stocks are worth buying or if Steve's parents should look at different stocks.  We used two different codes to run the same script in case his parents wanted to expand the selection of stocks they use.  Refactoring our code makes it more efficient, uses up less memory, and is easier to decipher for fellow coders.

# 2.) Results

As you can see from the workbook and the macros we ran 2017 was a much better year for stocks compared to 2018.  Only one stock was in the red in 2017. This compares to only two stocks in the green in 2018.  This was a huge difference in performance year over year.  

# 3.)Summary

  a.)Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code

  b.)Pros and cons apply to refactoring the original scripts
