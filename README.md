# 1.) Overview

For this task we helped our friend Steve's parents analyze some of their favorite energy stocks to see how they performed over a couple years.  Using this anaylsis we can decide if the stocks are worth buying or if Steve's parents should look at different stocks.  We used two different codes to run the same script in case his parents wanted to expand the selection of stocks they use.  Refactoring our code makes it more efficient, uses up less memory, and is easier to decipher for fellow coders.

# 2.) Results

As you can see from the images from our workbook and the macros we ran, 2017 was a much better year for stocks compared to 2018.

Only one stock was in the red in 2017. This compares to only two stocks in the green in 2018.  This was a huge difference in performance year over year.

We used two different codes to measure the same results.  You can see the results of the original macro vs the refactored macro we ran below.

# 3.)Summary

  a.) A couple advantages of using the refactored code is that it is easier to read and more concise.  Updaing this code would be easier as well and helps the program run faster.  One disadvantage would be that by shorting it up and skipping steps you could create new errors in the system.  Also, if you are not well versed it could be very time consuming trying to come up with a refactor.

  b.)A big advantage of refactoring this specific code was the run time it took for the macro.  It was almost 10x faster!  I didn't notice a particular disadvantage for this set but imagine working from scratch it would take a lot of time.
